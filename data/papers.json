      "abstract": "This paper reports results from two workshops organized with children with visual impairments ranging from blindness to low vision. The aim of the workshops was to suggest gestures for the interaction with a small wearable audio-bracelet. Results show a preference for mechanical buttons and touch-based gestures on the device (mainly tapping and sliding), while only one tentative suggestion is made for a gesture made with the device (shaking).

      "abstract": "In this work-in-progress paper, we make a case for leveraging the unique affordances of the human ear for eyes-free, mobile interaction. We present EarPut, a novel interface concept, which instruments the ear as an interactive surface for touch-based interactions and its prototypical hardware implementation. The central idea behind EarPut is to go beyond prior work by unobtrusively augmenting a variety of accessories that are worn behind the ear, such as headsets or glasses. Results from a controlled experiment with 27 participants provide empirical evidence that people are able to target salient regions on their ear effectively and precisely. Moreover, we contribute a first, systematically derived interaction design space for ear-based interaction and a set of exemplary applications.  Author",
